this website was made using free open source software :
[[obsidian]] and the [flowershow](https://flowershow.app/) plug in.

and it is hosted for free by github

also vercel (which has a free tier) does something but i am not entirely sure what :) except it sends a scary message when i've fucked up some code and it can't update the site.

why pay obsidian $8 a month to publish some obsidian notes when you can use flowershow?

---------------------------------------------------------

well depends on whether paying $8 a month is a problem for you
and you might like to support obsidian.

and whether or not you can be bothered to fuck around.

it involves github and a thing called vercel which i didn't know about.

it is all described in detail here
