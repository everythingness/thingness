the last time i went into an actual shop to buy a product other than food, one of the shop assistants, who are now referred to as consultants, asked me what i was going to use it for. i was buying an external drive for a computer and there is really only one thing you can do with those, although they are so small these days that with a bit of lubrication it would be easily insertable into the anus of a consultant.
