you hate blurbs and the people who write blurbs but it seems to be necessary to have blurbs, so someone has to write them â€” or you could use Ai.

<p>

now if the blurb about the movie you saw yesterday was written by Ai you would say, ah the cheapskates used Ai. fuck them. but if it was written by a human you would be full of rage and scorn and curse the world and everything in it.
<p>

the blurb says: 

> The past collides with our present in Steve McQueen's daring documentary The Occupied City (De Bezette Stad), inspired by the book Atlas of an Occupied City Amsterdam 1940-1945 by Bianca Stigter. McQueen creates two interlocking portraits: one shows door-to-door the Nazi occupation that still haunts the city, the other is a vivid journey through the last years of pandemic and protest. What emerges is both shattering and hopeful, a far-reaching meditation on memory, time and what lies ahead.

this is without any shadow of a doubt a human piece of crap but it doesn't help anyone if you are full of scorn and rage.
