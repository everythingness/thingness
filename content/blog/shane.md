some people's deaths affect you more than others. if someone was the same age, which happens more and more frequently as you age, and if they are in the public eye, you kind of live your so-called life alongside them.

it's minus 7 in helsinki and half time is over in <strike>hell</strike> gaza. i was in a bad mood yesterday after learning of the death of shane macgowan. we were both 19 in 1977.

his band was the nipple erectors, mine was [the violators](http://punk77.co.uk/groups/violators.htm) and both our bands were shit. we were on the same bill for a gig that never happened. it's more than likely that he saw us play at the last night of the old roxy on the 23rd of april 1977 because everyone who was anyone was there and he was someone. and anyway shane was part of the roxy's furniture. 

he was fucking mad as a hatter, i was not. he was hard core. i was not. he'd been living in squats in the inner city since the age of 15 and drinking hard and taking hard drugs. we were just soft suburban boys still living with their mothers. there was an edge to shane, an air of danger around him. if you got gobbed on by him it would be an honour but he was just as likely to headbutt you or bite a piece of your ear off.

and then the punk scene disintegrated as the capitalists and the posers moved in. johnny rotten became john lydon and i didn't become the guitarist in his new band. shane reinvented himself as a magical performer and before old age and hard living caught up with him, he sang and wrote at least two sublime ageless songs, dirty old town and [a pair of brown eyes](https://every.thingness.link/files/a-pair-of-brown-eyes.mp4), one of the saddest songs ever about war and love.

and then we were both old men and [shane got his teeth fixed live on TV](https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/dec/20/shane-macgowan-a-wreck-reborn-new-teeth-tv-special) and i didn't.  
and i stopped drinking and doing drugs and i don't think he did.  
and then he died and i didn't.   
so it goes.
