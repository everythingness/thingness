The current temperature at Sydney Airport is 43.5, and the current temperature of my CPU is 49 degrees (or 55 depending on what you measure) but I am cool since fixing my inability to access archive.today (which is a website where you can read articles from The Times etc when you encounter paywalls which cannot be circumvented by a bypass paywalls extension). For the last few months I have been encountering the dreaded [infinite CAPTCHA loop problem](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=infinite+CAPTCHA+loop+problem&ia=web) which causes the brains of people on the internet all over the world to reach boiling point very quickly.

What fixed it for me was to use Quad9 DNS settings:<br>
IPv4 9.9.9.9 and 149.112.112.112  
IPv6 2620:fe::fe and 2620:fe::9

On a Mac open System Preferences, select Network, select WiFi, add a new Location (call it Quad9 or something else), set it to use that Location and then select Advanced, then select DNS and put in the numbers above and click on Apply.

oh wait. it stopped working. but then i set the DNS back to Automatic and it worked again. and then it stopped working again. and then i set the DNS back to Quad9 and it worked again.

what does it mean?!

ok so that was a boring nerdy post. but
[tomorrow](https://every.thingness.link/20231210-081632) will be better.
